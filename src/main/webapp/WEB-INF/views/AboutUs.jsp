Titan Company brought about a paradigm shift in the Indian watch market when it introduced its futuristic quartz technology, complemented by international styling. Titan Company is the fifth largest integrated own brand watch manufacturer in the world. In addition to 'Titan' the watch brand, Titan Company has also built 'Tanishq' the leading jewellery brand over the past few years. Both these brands are among the most recognised and loved brands in India.
The success story began in 1984 with a joint venture between the Tata Group and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation. Presenting Titan quartz watches that sported an international look, Titan Company transformed the Indian watch market. After Sonata, a value brand of functionally styled watches at affordable prices, Titan Company reached out to the youth segment with Fastrack, its third brand, trendy and chic. The company has sold 150 million watches world over and manufactures over 15 million watches every year.
With a license for premium fashion watches of global brands, Titan Company repeated its pioneering act and brought international brands into the Indian market. Tommy Hilfiger, FCUK, Timberland &amp; Police as well as the Swiss made watch – Xylys owe their presence in the Indian market to Titan Company.
Entering the largely fragmented Indian jewellery market with no known brands in 1995, Titan Company launched Tanishq, India's most trusted and fastest growing jewellery brand. Gold Plus, the later addition, focuses on the preferences of semi-urban and rural India. Completing the jewellery portfolio is Zoya, the latest retail chain in the luxury segment.
Titan Company has also made its foray into eyewear, offering a variety of differentiated products to the end consumer consisting of frames, lenses, contact lenses and accessories. Frames are available in both international brands (Levis, Esprit, Hugo Boss etc.) and in-house brands – Titan, Eye+ and Dash which is an offering for children. The company has leveraged its manufacturing competencies and branched into precision engineering components &amp; sub-assemblies, machine building &amp; automation solutions, tooling solutions and electronic sub-assemblies. With over 1200 exclusive retail stores across a carpet area of over 1.6 million sq. ft. Titan Company has India's largest retail network spanning over 220 towns. The company has over 400 exclusive 'World of Titan' showrooms and over 150 Fastrack stores. It also has a large network of over 740 after-sales-service centres.
Titan Company is also the largest jewellery retailer in India with over 160 Tanishq boutiques and 2 Zoya stores, over 30 Gold Plus stores. It also sports over 300 Titan Eye+ stores. In addition the company retails personal accessories such as bags, belts, wallets and most recently perfumes under Skinn Brand.
Backed by over 7,000 employees, two exclusive design studios for watches and jewellery, 12 manufacturing units, and innumerable admirers' world over, Titan Company continues to grow and set new standards for innovation and quality. The organization is all geared to repeat the Titan and Tanishq success story with each new offering. </p>
